## Developer 

Hello, I'm ***Noolyz***, the sole developer of Nyks, not only for the bot but also for the website.

I'm a developer, not highly advanced, but I know my way around. I started this project on my own and I'm also finishing it solo. However, for future updates, I'd like to have at least a group of people, but that will be seen.

You can see me here:
